This license applies to all folders and files within the Projects repository structure. The structure includes multiple project folders, such as:

Each project folder may contain dated subfolders (e.g., 2025‑11‑25, 2025‑11‑26, etc.). These names and dates are provided as examples only. The license applies equally to all current and future projects, folders, and files created under the Projects structure.
